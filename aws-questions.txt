1   Difference between IAM Policy and Roles
-->> IAM Roles manage who has access to your AWS resources, whereas IAM policies control their permissions.

     A Role with no Policy attached to it won’t have to access any AWS resources.

     A Policy that is not attached to an IAM role is effectively unused. Permissions listed in an IAM policy are only enforced when that policy is attached to an IAM identity.

     Therefore, you should IAM roles and policies together to manage the security of your AWS resources
 
2    MFA
-->>Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is a second form of authentication that verifies a user's identity before granting them access.
    With MFA, admins can deploy authentication policies that implement additional security while respecting employees’ time and work. MFA factors include:

    *  Mobile device push notifications for iOS and Android authenticator apps
    *  Biometric (face and fingerprint scan)
    *  Voice recognition
    *  SMS codes
    *  One-time passwords

4   S3 static website hosting prop
-->> Step 1: Create a bucket
     Step 2: Enable static website hosting --Properties--Static website hosting---choose Edit-- index.html(type in the box)
     Step 3: Edit Block Public Access settings ----Permissions----Block public access (bucket settings)---Edit----Block all public access---Save changes
     Step 4: Add a bucket policy that makes your bucket content publicly available---


5   S3 versioning
-->> You can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket so that 
     you can restore objects that are accidentally deleted or overwritten
       Buckets can be in one of the three states
          * Unversioned (the default)
          * Versioning-enabled
          * Versioning-suspended
      As Versioning maintains multiple copies of the same objects as a whole and charges accrue for multiple versions for 
      e.g. for a 1GB file with 5 copies with minor differences would consume 5GB of S3 storage space and you would be charged for the same.
