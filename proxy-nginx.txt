how to setup reverse proxy on aws instance

To set up a reverse proxy on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance, you can use a web server software such as Apache or Nginx. Here are the general steps to set up a reverse proxy using Nginx:

Launch an EC2 instance and log in to it via SSH.

Install Nginx:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx

Create a new Nginx virtual host configuration file for the reverse proxy. For example, you can create a file at /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse_proxy.conf with the following contents:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://origin_server_ip_or_hostname:origin_server_port;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}

Replace example.com with the domain name you want to use for your reverse proxy, and origin_server_ip_or_hostname:origin_server_port with the IP address or hostname and port of the origin server.

Enable the virtual host by creating a symbolic link from the sites-available directory to the sites-enabled directory:

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse_proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

Test the Nginx configuration:

sudo nginx -t

Restart Nginx to apply the changes:
sudo service nginx restart


erify that the reverse proxy is working by accessing it from a web browser using the public IP address or hostname of your EC2 instance. Requests to the reverse proxy should be transparently forwarded to the origin server.
